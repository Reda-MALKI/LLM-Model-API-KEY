This project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) via an API (Gemini API KEY) to perform intelligent text processing tasks in MOROCCAN DARIJA such as answering questions, generating content, summarizing text, and more — without training or fine-tuning the model locally.

 Key Features:
API-Based Integration: Used API keys to securely connect to a hosted LLM service.

Prompt Engineering: Designed and tested effective prompts to guide the model’s behavior based on specific use cases.

Dynamic Input Handling: Built a user-friendly interface to send real-time queries and receive responses.

Use Cases: Content generation, chatbot simulation, discussing everything related to moroccan culture.

Technologies Used:
Language Model: GEMINI 

Languages: Python 

Libraries: requests, langchain_google_genai, streamlit frontend/backend interaction
